**The VC-Driven Entrepreneurship Fairy Tale**\
Once upon a time in Silicon Valley, a group of venture capitalists sat around a table, sipping on their overpriced lattes, and thought, "How can we make entrepreneurship sound like a blockbuster movie?" And thus, the mainstream entrepreneurship narrative was born. Forget about starting a small bakery or a local gym; if you're not aiming for a billion-dollar valuation, are you even an entrepreneur?

**The Myth of the "Next Big Thing"**\
Every entrepreneur now dreams of being the next Zuckerberg or Musk. But here's the catch: not every idea is meant to be the next Facebook or Tesla. Remember that guy who tried to make a social network for cats? Or the startup that wanted to Uberize the pencil-sharpening industry? Yep, all products of the "go big or go home" mentality. And while we're laughing, someone out there is pitching "Airbnb for goldfish" to a room full of VCs.

**The Disappearing Act of Small Businesses**\
While everyone's busy chasing unicorn dreams, the heart and soul of our economy – small businesses – are quietly fading into the background.

But with the narrative so skewed, she's left wondering if she should pivot to a virtual reality book experience or risk being labeled "outdated."

**The Real Culprit: Not Just "Tech"**\
It's easy to point fingers at "tech" as the big bad wolf huffing and puffing away small businesses. But let's be real: it's not just tech. It's the illusion that every business needs to fit the Silicon Valley mold. It's the pressure to scale at lightning speed or be deemed a failure. It's the endless chase for inflated valuations over genuine value creation.

**The Call for a New Narrative**\
It's high time we bring back the glory of the mom-and-pop shops, the local artisans, and the small-town cafes. Entrepreneurship isn't just about creating the next tech giant; it's about passion, community, and making a difference, one small step at a time. So, the next time someone tells you about their idea for a "blockchain-powered, AI-driven, gluten-free sandwich platform," just nod, smile, and ask them if they've considered opening a sandwich shop instead.
