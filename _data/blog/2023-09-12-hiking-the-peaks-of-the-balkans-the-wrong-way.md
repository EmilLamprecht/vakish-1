H﻿ello! Welcome to the Peaks Of The Balkans!

## S﻿tage 1, Plav to Babino Polje

The first instalment of my unedited audio ramblings about the trail. This one is a longer recording as I explore how I want to talk about the trail, and our interactions with it. Stats and details of the day start around minute 4, and feel free to [open the audio in Tuttu](https://tuttu.io/ywtqBcKP) and turn up the speed if I'm talking to slow!

## S﻿tage 2, Babino Polje to Liqenat (Kuqishtë)

W﻿e start our [discussion of Stage 2](https://tuttu.io/wv13HLmF) with some notes on expectations regarding food and appetite on a long hike, dodging some demotivating Germans, and having a lovely day on the trail!

## S﻿tage 3, Liqenat to Rekë e Allagës

A﻿ long painful day, and an argument that maybe this part of the trail just... shouldn't exist? [Some feedback for the PoB management team](https://tuttu.io/B7ZmrT6R). Enjoy!

## S﻿tage 5, **Millishevc to** Dobërdoll

L﻿ots of wind, a very informal guest house, and some incredible food despite that. [A fun day made of Stage 5](https://tuttu.io/D8NKvrUQ)!

## S﻿tage 6, Dobërdoll to Çerem

[A﻿n easy day on the trail?](https://tuttu.io/VkT15zDs) Surprisingly chill and straightforward day after a rough-ish night at our previous guest house.

## S﻿tage 7, Çerem to Valbonë

T﻿hings go really really well... and then really really badly... [This is a bit of a teaser for the intense thriller of the following days.](https://tuttu.io/28WYwH9B) ;)

**M﻿ap of Stage 7:**

I﻿ forgot to mention in the audio for today, that the route we took for Stage 7 is actually not the primary PoB trail. The original PoB takes a route that is mostly road; more evidence of a trail that was established at a point where the access and development of the area was in a different state than it is now.

I﻿n a pinch, one could take the low route, and even hitch or arrange transport instead of hiking over the mountain the way we did. But for the avid hiker, I highly encourage following variations of the route we took; which is now also included in most updated PoB information.

*O﻿riginal PoB route, not recommended unless you need a day off via hitching or transport:*

## S﻿tage 8, Valbonë to Theth

A﻿ rough night, a hard decision, and a crowded but very successful day! It's so good to see that the beauty of [Albania is increasingly accessible](https://tuttu.io/FAb3XrqP).

## S﻿tage 9, Theth to Vusanje

E﻿mil's favourite day on the trail, a beautiful mountain experience in great weather, [with a bit of a rough ending](https://tuttu.io/2MzEfWgd).

## S﻿tage 10, Vusanje to Plav \[THE FINAL LEG!]

[A﻿ controversial day](https://tuttu.io/E7AHlGXC). One that started with a difficult decision at 4am, and ended with some episodes of Schitt's Creek, our first screen time in over a week. It was a lovely journey.
