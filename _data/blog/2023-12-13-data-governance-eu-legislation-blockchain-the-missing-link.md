## What Is data governance and Why Is It Important?

As data evolves and grows increasingly more valuable, effective data governance is essential for businesses and governments alike. More data is being collected than ever before and staying up to date with existing regulations, embracing new technology, and participating in future policy initiatives will be crucial to drive innovation forward.

Data governance can seem daunting and complex. Especially if you, like me, set out to understand it through simply Googling the concept. But, after analysing a range of definitions, I think the best way to describe data governance is that it’s **the process, systems, and actions within an organisation to use data efficiently and effectively**.

In essence, data governance ensures additional control over data and enables participants to set rules and operations that safeguard assets. It encompasses technology, processes, availability, and the like, all under the broader umbrella of data management.

The EU’s recent Data Governance Act (DGA) provides fresh opportunities for organisations to further engage in trusted data sharing, especially in the public sector. It ensures that both protected and public sector data collected can be re-used through data sharing services. Staying up to date with the latest legislations, like the DGA, is paramount for organisations to successfully navigate the evolving data landscape.

Now, two challenges emerge: organisations must keep pace with new legislation, and the EU must craft new data governance guidelines that balance increased data sharing, data protection, and innovation. Achieving this interplay will allow the EU to continue championing the data-driven age.

My aim is to provide a comprehensive narrative to make understanding data governance a bit easier, while highlighting a few principles to help create a robust framework. I’ll also delve into the latest governmental regulations, such as the Data Governance Act, underscore blockchain’s potential in the context of data governance, and offer recommendations for navigating the ever-changing data landscape.

## Data Governance Principles

Many organisations are drowning in the data they collect. It is therefore essential to lend brain power and resources to data governance.

Imagine the impact of implementing a central framework that outlines who has access to what datasets, who is responsible for ensuring regulations are followed, and who is in charge if something goes wrong. Needless to say, data governance is critical for growing and protecting business operations. Without it, organisations put themselves in a vulnerable position, particularly when it comes to security breaches, compliance issues, and the risk of lagging behind competitors.

[A 2022 Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/choose-adaptive-data-governance-over-one-size-fits-all-for-greater-flexibility) estimates that 80 percent of organisations seeking to scale digital businesses will fail in the next three years because they aren’t prioritising data governance.

Now, more than ever before, it is paramount for organisations to stay on top of data governance and set out a plan for using and sharing data most effectively. Industry leader, [Nikola Askham](https://www.nicolaaskham.com/), says that the primary purpose of implementing a data governance framework is to manage and improve data quality. Effective governance has the power to organise and streamline information, establish data policies, and ultimately help monetise it. Well-governed data can unlock value and insights that can help organisations stay competitive and see a measurable ROI.

While there are several different data governance frameworks available, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. A customised framework is necessary to maximise the benefits of data. Moreover, data governance principles will vary depending on the organisation, whether it is private or public, and the type of industry.

The [Data Governance Institute](https://datagovernance.com/goals-and-principles-for-data-governance/) advises organisations to establish principles that suit their respective environment. For instance, if a goal is to navigate internal politics, then the principles should prioritise accountability. If the goal is to ensure data is more organised and standardised, leaders should emphasise transparency and audibility.

Data is already inherently complex. That’s why many data governance experts underscore the importance of keeping things simple when choosing which framework to adopt and which principles are most applicable. Drawing from the Data Governance Institute and other thought leaders, such as [Nicola Askham,](https://www.nicolaaskham.com/) [Uma Gupta & San Cannon](https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/9781789735673), and [Robert S. Seiner](https://technicspub.com/nidg/), I’ve picked out five key principles that should guide an organisation’s framework and strategy.

1. **Transparency** – Ensuring data is openly available to relevant stakeholders allows for faster and more efficient decision making while also creating trust in the organisation’s data management capabilities.
2. **Accountability** – Clarifying and assigning roles, such as data owners and data stewards, is crucial to achieve success and ensuring each stakeholder is accountable for complying with regulations and policies. Note: A data owner has complete authority and sign-off on a dataset, whereas a data steward is responsible for the day-to-day management of datasets.
3. **Audibility** – This is crucial to assess compliance with regulations. As part of this, decisions pertaining to data must be documented to ensure compliance.
4. **Security** – Security is key in any data governance framework and is essential to control and safeguard sensitive data.
5. **Credibility** – Trusted oversight, transparency, and verifiable compliance supports the credibility of the data governance system, and therefore the organisation.

Integrating these principles in a data governance strategy streamlines data management operations. It not only simplifies compliance, but eventually saves time and resources that can be put toward further optimising data for insights and profit.

It is also worth noting the difference between data governance and data management, especially when defining a governance framework. While they both work together to make the most out of data, they are often miscommunicated.

In short, data governance is just one part of the overarching theme of data management. It puts in place policies and processes when it comes to data ownership and accountability. Data management, on the other hand, is more operational and acts as an umbrella term that encompasses other aspects such as data security, data quality, and data analytics and reporting. It is important to get the language right here.

## Data Governance and Blockchain

So far, I’ve gone over what data governance is and key principles to consider when building a framework.  But the question remains: What tool can ensure that data is accessible, secure, and transparent? The answer, I think, lies in blockchain.

Blockchain, as a decentralised, transparent, and secure digital ledger technology, can significantly support data governance initiatives and spearhead future innovation in this space.

By recording and verifying information across multiple professional data centres, it ensures that transactions are stored securely and cannot be tampered with. No block in the chain can be altered without all other subsequent blocks also being altered, something which would be rejected by the other data centres. Thereby, a safe platform is established — one which also allows for easy data sharing. Blockchain can ultimately help streamline data governance efforts, and guide government initiatives in the data sphere.

Governments have been actively acknowledging the strengths of blockchain for years now. Back in 2016, the UK government released [a report highlighting the futuristic capabilities it has to offer](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a818d6fe5274a2e87dbe3dd/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf):

> “Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services.”

Similarly, the German government adopted a [blockchain strategy in 2019](https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2019/2019-18-09-joint-release-with-bmwi.html). The goal here was that, in providing a policy framework, governments can use blockchain to its full potential and prevent its misuse. The strategy prioritises finance, administration, health, and collaboration among networks. Germany’s Federal Minister of Economics, Peter Altmaier, said:

> “Blockchain is a new technology with great potential. Germany is one of the world’s leading locations for this technology. Our blockchain strategy aims to help maintain and expand this leading position.”

International bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also showed support for blockchain in a [2018 report](https://one.oecd.org/document/DAF/CA/CG/RD(2018)1/REV1/En/pdf):

> “Mind-blowing advances in computing and communication technologies continually give rise to new risks related to cybersecurity, privacy protection, and oligopolistic concentration in information control. Whatever the potential tangible value of blockchains may be in everyday life, studying the issue will certainly be very useful for businesses and policy makers in updating their mindsets and to keep abreast of the pros and cons, and the opportunities and challenges, of new technologies.”

## EU Data Governance Policies

To add another level of complexity to this topic, there are several EU policies relating to data governance that organisations need to be aware of. Having dug into the nitty gritty of this topic, my aim is to make this as digestible as possible.

I’ll start by saying [most of the international community agrees that society is in a pivotal moment in the data economy.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi)As mentioned, many governments are not taking solely individual approaches to data governance policies, but are also making collective efforts.

The EU has taken significant steps to promote data sharing through policies like the DGA, the Open Data Directive, and most recently the Data Act. It recognises that in order to use data to its full potential, more data needs to be made available, shared with confidence, and easy to re-use. Of course, sharing and re-using must also abide by the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR), which allows individuals more control over their own data. More on that to come in a later article.

> “In order to truly capitalise on this enormous potential, more data must be made available, shared with confidence and technically easy to re-use.” - [Data Governance Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained)

The DGA aims to create a framework to promote re-using and sharing protected or public data, while promoting data altruism, across various industries, including health, agriculture, finance, and public administration. It is a key component of the [EU Digital Strategy](https://eufordigital.eu/discover-eu/eu-digital-strategy/) and the EU’s wider policy agenda. It focuses on providing rules and mechanisms for sharing data between businesses, public sectors, private sectors, and between individuals.

Preceding the Data Governance Act was the [Open Data Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024) in 2019. This policy required public sector bodies in the EU to make data available to re-use, but it excluded protected data. It also mandated open formats, transparency, and implemented mechanisms to balance openness with privacy. The aim was to spark innovation on an organisational and individual level by making more data publicly available to re-use.

The key difference between the DGA and the Open Data Directive is that the later mandates open public sector data in the EU. Whereas the DGA recognises private data is also very valuable, and insight can be obtained without compromising the security of the data. The DGA encourages, but does not mandate, private data sharing between sectors and aims to provide a set of rules to facilitate re-use where possible.

The DGA presents four focus pillars — and many of them have significant overlap with the capabilities of  blockchain.

**Pillar 1.** The first is to re-use sensitive data held by public sector bodies. To do so, public bodies must be technically equipped to protect privacy and confidentiality. The EU recommends using anonymisation, pseudonymisation, or accessing data in secure environments such as data rooms. Blockchain is, by nature, pseudonymous and provides the ability to access data in securely and confidentially.

**Pillar 2.** The second pillar aims to create a more open and accessible environment for data sharing within a single market. The DGA outlines that public bodies will assist re-users in getting consent or permission for the re-using of data if it cannot grant access to certain data itself. Blockchain can assist with this by allowing users to hold their own keys, thereby allowing them to give or take away access to information at any time. The pillar also limits exclusivity agreements to ensure that data can more accessible. Lastly, the EU will provide intermediation services to increase trust in data sharing, transparency, and neutrality. The intermediaries will be under strict requirements to ensure they remain neutral and there are no conflicts of interest in B2B data sharing.

**Pillar 3.** The third pillar focuses on corporate and individual data altruism. Entities that choose to make data available will be able to register as “[data altruism organisations recognised in the Union.”](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-altruism-organisations) In order to do so, organisations must comply with the DGA rulebook developed by the EU, and meet transparency and security requirements. An example used to outline how this can work in practice is the German [Corona Datenspende-App,](https://corona-datenspende.de/) a platform that collected data from smartwatches and shared it with researchers, who could then identify COVID-19 hotspots.

**Pillar 4.** The fourth pillar focuses on coordinating national practices and policies. A [European Data Innovation Board (EDIB)](https://european-big-data-value-forum.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/EBDVF-2022_EDIB_DSSC-WS.pdf) is being built to help facilitate sharing information and best practices, and will include representatives from the Commission and from Member States. Blockchain provides a common platform, while also allowing each national government or organisation to customise their implementation as they see fit. The next step in the EU Digital Strategy has been to adopt the [European Data Act](https://www.eu-data-act.com/), which further outlines processes and structures to facilitate data sharing. Importantly, it clarifies who can access data and under which conditions.

The EU has been rolling out several new initiatives to encourage sharing and re-using data to foster innovation and collaboration. And again, I believe regulations can be further propelled forward by having blockchain as its backbone. The immutable ledgers, transparency, and ability to track data can help further facilitate data sharing and cross collaboration between different sectors.

## Data Governance Challenges and Trends

Data governance faces challenges both on an international and organisational level. Some of the key challenges include data privacy, change management, data ownership, and accountability. Data privacy, for instance, will need to align seamlessly with all other regulations, such as the GDPR.

The DGA does outline how it will approach the gathering and protecting of sensitive data, however it seems a bit light touch for what is being proposed. As data becomes a valuable asset both for individuals and for organisations, it will be paramount for comprehensive, safeguarding processes to be put in place to further protect it. One of the proposals was to have Member States designate bodies to advise on re-use and provide secure data environments. These policies need to be further developed and streamlined in order to ensure maximum data security. As the data landscape is rapidly changing, it is also crucial that procedures are continually updated to address evolving threats and challenges.

Another challenge to consider is the cultural shift required to implement data governance structures both within organisations and to align with international standards. The shift will inevitably disrupt existing processes and workflows and, in my view, organisations will need much more than mere encouragement to make changes. There needs to be additional incentives to achieve active participation and continue harnessing valuable data. For this to succeed long-term, employees, citizens, and individuals will need to embrace these new practices. Consequently, it becomes imperative to provide accessible resources that highlight the benefits of the transformation.

Despite its promising features, blockchain comes with its own limitations. One of the biggest critiques of utilising blockchain when it comes to data governance is the scalability of the technology. If used in the way this article proposes, it will need to accommodate the ever-growing volume of data. Its core architecture requires network participants to validate transactions, which can lead to inefficiencies and disruption as the network grows to meet demand. Blockchain’s evolution must meet the increasing demands of data governance structures for it to have a key role in the coming years. However, BSV-based blockchain-as-a-service platform [mintBlue](https://mintblue.com/) is showing promising signs that this is possible. They recently broke the proof-of-work world record with [over 50 million transactions within 24 hours](https://www.bsvblockchain.org/news/mintblue-smashes-proof-of-work-record-50-million-transactions) and claim this is just a fraction of what blockchain is capable of. The blockchain protocol chosen will play a huge role in determining the costs, ability for widespread adoption, and the limits of the implementation itself.

As data management and data governance become a more integrated part of every organisation, innovation will continue to excel. The techniques for implementing a robust data governance framework will become more applicable to a wider range of industries and the DGA will ensure more organisational collaboration than ever before.

There are experts, such as mintBlue, who have set out to empower a greater use of blockchain capabilities that can assist with data governance frameworks. These experts set out to help revolutionise data management through streamlining information and making it a lot easier to control. Gaining insights from them can only serve to help businesses prepare and structure frameworks for better data insights and increased ROI.

## Where Does That Leave Things?

Data governance is no longer a trend but a necessity for organisations. Large amounts of data come with a lot of responsibility. Building cutting-edge technology, such as blockchain, into data governance frameworks can help streamline processes well into the future. While there is still a long way to go in terms of finding a consistent technology across industries for data sharing, blockchain is here to stay. It can play an increasingly prominent role, and, if managed correctly, can evolve alongside policies like the DGA.  By combining data governance with blockchain, leaders can be at the forefront of the future of data governance. This is only the beginning of unlocking the potential of data sharing in a digital world.
