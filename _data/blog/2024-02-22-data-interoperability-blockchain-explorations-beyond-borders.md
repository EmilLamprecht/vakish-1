## <div id="what-is">What Is Data Interoperability?</div>

[Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?scope=Entries&q=interoperability) defines interoperability as the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information. An easy example I think many of us can relate to is the interoperability (or lack thereof!) between Android and iOS devices. Having previously worked at a smartphone company, this is a particularly sore spot for me.

*Data* interoperability relies on a similar definition with the added variable. The [Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](https://www.data4sdgs.org/) defines interoperability as:

> *"The ability to access and process data from multiple sources without losing meaning and then integrate that data for mapping, visualization, and other forms of analysis. In essence, it is the ability to ‘join-up’ data from different sources to help create more holistic and contextual information for simpler, and sometimes automated, analysis, better decision-making, and accountability purposes."*

When it comes to data, interoperability is key. Put simply:

> *"Interoperability is a* characteristic *of good quality data, and it relates to broader concepts of value, knowledge creation, collaboration, and fitness-for-purpose."*\
> — [Luis Gonzalez, UNSD](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/InteropGuide/Introduction)

With data flowing from multiple platforms and systems, the need for it all to work together is essential. Take healthcare data as an example: If doctors are uploading and accessing patient information in two different platforms, they need to be able to read and access that data without changing the meaning. The two systems must interpret and relay data from several different inputs to perform a smooth transfer of information.

Data interoperability isn't just industry specific. By linking and utilising data from several industries, both nationally and globally, governments can use data to its full potential — especially as data and evidence is the backbone of policy-making. Finding new ways for data to interact in a more efficient way will ultimately allow policy-makers to collate more evidence and make lasting and meaningful change — at least, that's the goal.

My aim in this article is to explore how data interoperability is already integrated into several government initiatives, all the way from regional to the global level. I will then give my take on the pros and cons as to how this is currently working, as well as explain how blockchain can add considerable value moving forward.

## <div id="approaches">Data Interoperability Approaches: Regional, National, & Global Perspectives</div>

As I mentioned, data interoperability is extremely important for governments to collate and analyse vast amounts of data. And there have been efforts regarding cross-national cooperation to make this even more efficient.

### Data Interoperability Collaborative

In 2017, global decision-makers quickly realised that in order to make [the 2030 agenda](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) a reality, lots and lots of data was going to have to work together to make clear evidence for change — particularly in relation to sustainable development.

This is one complex challenge. It means taking data from several different countries, operating on numerous different systems, in a way that pertains to several different aspects of life, and then making it work together to compare information globally.

As part of this, the [Data Interoperability Collaborative](https://www.data4sdgs.org/initiatives/data-interoperability-collaborative), co-governed by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and the UN Statistics Division, [released a report](file:///Data%20interoperability/%20A%20practitioner's%20guide%20to%20joining%20up%20data%20in%20the%20development%20sector) to make this a reality. This is a lengthy, detailed report, but it's a great tool and outlines a framework to enhance data interoperability from a global standpoint. The report discusses the importance of effective data governance to ensure organisations are accountable and maintain oversight of where data is going.

I talk about data governance in [previous](https://policyblocks.co/data-governance/) [articles](https://policyblocks.co/data-governance-act-blockchain/) but it's important to note the interlink between the two. The report goes on to discuss metadata models to overcome structural barriers, the role of standard classifications and vocabularies, open data formats to make data discoverable, and guidance on open data and the online sharing of statistics.

An organisation called [DataReady](https://dataready.org/casestudy/working-with-gpsdd-to-promote-data-interoperability/) helps oversee the Collaborative and has helped the international organisations achieve greater openness to official statistics.

> *"Together, \[the Collaborative] have produced detailed policy guidance on interoperability for sustainable development practitioners. We are now supporting the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development's efforts to test this guidance in Kenya and elsewhere, with the aim of improving how data is governed, shared and used in pursuit of development objectives."*\
> — DataReady

Having a report like this available to guide data interoperability internationally can only help use data in a more efficient and impactful way. However, I do wonder if this Collaborative has been left by the wayside as there isn't any actual information as to how it's being used in other areas around the world. Frankly, it's all very vague, which is a real shame because, when used to their full potential, these tools could help guide sustainable development.

### Interoperable Europe Act

From the European Union’s perspective, data interoperability is front of mind. As I've discussed previously, the EU is striving to achieve digital transformation objectives by 2030 and is working to establish a [Digital Single Market](https://eufordigital.eu/discover-eu/eu-digital-strategy/) to foster a seamless digital environment across Europe. This involves promoting and facilitating free-flowing data across borders within the region, necessitating a focus on interoperability.

Up until now, participating in data interoperability initiatives was voluntary. But to expand capabilities, the EU recently proposed the [Interoperable Europe Act](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/13/interoperable-europe-act-council-and-parliament-strike-a-deal-for-more-efficient-digital-public-services-across-the-eu/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20aims%20to%20set,enhancing%20skills%20and%20knowledge%20exchange.) as a comprehensive solution to create an interconnected data sharing network.

The EU sees this as a key milestone in creating an ecosystem of shared data in the public sector. It has set out a [European Interoperability Framework](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/european-interoperability-framework-detail) that defines interoperability guidelines, common principles, and recommendations for public administrators. To enhance knowledge sharing, there will be an Interoperable Europe portal created. This is a multi-level governance operation where projects are co-owned by Member States and steered by the Interoperable Europe Board. The Act still needs to be approved, but at the time of writing, that seems likely to happen in the upcoming months.

### National Interoperability Framework Observatory

So, what does this look like for individual countries within the EU? To implement the Interoperability Framework, the European Commission has put in place the [National Interoperability Framework Observatory](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory). It describes its aims as:

> *"The main mission of NIFO is to monitor the implementation of the revised version of the [European Interoperability Framework](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/glossary/term/european-interoperability-framework) and to help foster the capacity building policy and modernisation of public administrations. By doing so, it aims at becoming an online community of practice and the prime source of information regarding digital public administration and interoperability matters within Europe."*\
> — [European Commission](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/about)

Essentially, it provides tools for countries to stay in the know about all things related to data interoperability. Much of this will be industry-specific. I'll use the healthcare industry again as an example: Through ensuring data works together, EU countries can share health information with one another and deliver seamless services across the region. Operationally speaking, it will mean that existing National Interoperability Frameworks align with the European Interoperability Frameworks and allow for cross-border information sharing. It will ultimately promote collaboration, cut costs, and help meet a standard of care, if all goes according to plan.

## <div id="pros-cons">Pros & Cons Of The EU's Data Interoperability Approaches</div>

I view data interoperability between countries as a positive advancement toward sharing information and collaborating with one another. It improves efficiency, allows countries access to more data, and fosters a collaborative global mindset. It also spreads resources, which I'm a big fan of. Less wealthy countries will inevitably have less time and resource to collect and interpret data at the same speed as more wealthy countries. Through creating a more open source, it allows data to be free-flowing, regardless of economic or financial circumstances.

But (there's always a but!) we can see how a system like this is prone to shortfalls. Consider data protection and safeguarding, for example. The more data is free-flowing, the harder it is for citizens to track where their personal data ends up around the world. There will need to be a lot of behind-the-scenes work to ensure this aligns with EU's [General Data Protection Regulations](https://gdpr.eu/).

There's also the risk of cyberattacks. The more interconnected systems become, the more they can increase the risk of cybersecurity threats. It will be paramount to ensure there are tight restrictions and robust data governance systems in place to reduce the risk of breaches.

And last, but certainly not least, is the need to address cross-border legal and regulatory challenges. Promoting interoperability within the EU will be a much easier task than internationally. Complying with each country's regulations and legal requirements will be no small feat. To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been too much more than the international interoperability initiative I mentioned above, and I would imagine this is why.

## <div id="blockchain">Data Interoperability & Blockchain</div>

Now, due to the focus of this site, you're probably wondering the obvious — what does blockchain have to do with data interoperability? Good question. The short answer is: Through using one common system and cross-chain communication, while embracing a collaborative and secure network, it makes a great tool to enhance all of the initiatives I mentioned above.

A common road block government organisations face is how to integrate several different datasets into one reliable system. Blockchain provides a potential solution by offering a decentralised and secure platform. And through leveraging cross-chain communication protocols, various blockchain networks can collaborate, facilitate, and provide an efficient way of processing data.

This has the potential to revolutionise the way governments rely on international datasets, enhancing collaboration while simultaneously cutting time and expenses.

To make this seem less abstract, I'll use the example of smart contracts. Smart contracts are documents that operate on a decentralised platform and are designed to be compatible across multiple platforms. In essence, smart contracts created on one platform can work and utilise data from other compatible blockchain systems. And these are really very secure. The data within the contract can't be altered and allows several people access to verify the same set of data, all without relying on a central platform. Ultimately, these facilitate cross-organisational (or cross-governmental) collaboration through a document compatible across different blockchain platforms.  

The last thing blockchain offers that should be extremely attractive to governments is its security and scalability. This is something I've talked about in a few of my previous articles but I think it's what makes blockchain uniquely placed to be at the centre of emerging digital policies. By allowing data to flow seamlessly between networks, it can enhance performance and pave the way for future innovation. That, combined with the security element where changes are virtually impossible since they cannot be made without causing a ripple effect, underscores why I think it should be considered as a tool to enhance data interoperability.

That's not to say that using blockchain in this context won't come without its challenges. The most obvious being the investment and international consensus it would take to implement it. As I mentioned, governments are already working together through international bodies like the UN to create a more balanced approach to collecting and using data. However, blockchain adds another layer (or multiple layers) of negotiations and influencing.

**First**, there would need to be education around what blockchain is, what it does, and how it can transform interoperability.

**Second**, there would need to be a body in charge of taking control and presenting it as an option to the wider international community. That would mean that a country, or multiple countries, would be willing to stand up and advocate for the technology, leaning on experiences of implementation. Because governments have only just begun to realise the potential of blockchain, I can't see which nation would be confident enough at this point to take it on board.

**Lastly**, and arguably the most important, is that many will argue implementing blockchain could be expensive and time consuming. My counter argument is that implementing any new technology or system will be expensive. Some form of investment and time commitment is needed to avoid governments taking a reactive approach in the digital age. But, I would imagine that is not a very popular opinion when it comes down to practicalities.

Blockchain provides an ideal technical solution to help achieve many of the EU's digital goals. To circle back around to the topic of healthcare: Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a great example of what this could look like in practice. By using blockchain for EHRs, patients in the EU could access a single, unified health record that they can share with healthcare providers across the region. It would also ensure data is interoperable across the many different healthcare systems, allowing data to operate smoothly across borders. This not only demonstrates the impact of upfront investment, but showcases how relying on blockchain would help the EU achieve its digital strategy goals. Ultimately, it could help create a secure decentralised system to manage and access data in several industries.

## <div id="conclusion">Conclusion</div>

It's an exciting time for data interoperability, especially as the European Interoperability Act is set to come into play. No doubt there will be some kinks to iron out and it'll be most interesting to observe what challenges arise, and how the EU rises to these challenges.

My goal here was to summarise the key data interoperability policy considerations on regional, national, and international levels and highlight what I think the future could look like. It's an important area for everyone to watch. Regardless of where we live, our data is one of the most valuable assets we have, and it is crucial that, as citizens, we have a say in where and how it's managed.
