#### Accounting has been around for millennia and has revolutionised finance since its inception, but the first modern blockchain was [created in just 2009](https://www.icaew.com/technical/technology/blockchain-and-cryptoassets/blockchain-articles/what-is-blockchain/history). How are blockchain protocols, created thousands of years after the birth of accounting, being applied to the industry today?

## <div id="roots">The Roots Of Blockchain In Accounting</div>

A blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions is maintained across computers (known as nodes) linked in a peer-to-peer network. They rely on a decentralised ledger to record transactions made on the network and make them publicly verifiable.

The number of blockchain networks nowadays might [be in the thousands](https://watcher.guru/news/how-many-blockchains-are-there), but at their core, they all revolve around one simple idea — **data should be publicly verifiable, difficult to alter, and controlled by a network rather than a single entity**. It’s this idea that made the technology such a revolutionary concept when the Bitcoin whitepaper was published back in October 2008 (although interestingly, the term blockchain wasn’t actually used in the paper, Satoshi instead refers to it as a distributed timestamp server).

> *“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party... In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.”*\
> — [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Today however, what Satoshi spoke about is more commonly known as a blockchain, and its potential applications in a business context are vast. They include everything from supply chain management to voting and governance. It’s no different when it comes to accounting, which faces its own set of problems that the technology can help solve. But what are they?

## <div id="issues">The Issues With Modern Accounting & How Blockchain Can Help</div>

Accounting has obviously evolved significantly since its creation. Ideas like double-entry bookkeeping and common accounting standards, such as [GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp#:~:text=The%20generally%20accepted%20accounting%20principles%20(GAAP)%20are%20a%20set%20of,Accounting%20Standards%20Board%20(FASB).), have made it unrecognisable from the process [first created in Mesopotamia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/08/accounting-history.asp) over 7,000 years ago. However, there’s still plenty of room for improvement.

Blockchain certainly isn’t the ideal use case in some scenarios but it can help in a lot of areas, two of which I believe are especially important in relation to accounting — **transparency** and **automation**.

### Transparency

You don’t have to look far to find problems with the modern accounting process. Scandals like [Enron](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/enron-scandal-summary/) in 2001 or [Bernie Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp) in 2008 lay bare just how easy it is for the ill-intentioned to fiddle company numbers with shady accounting practices. Transparency is one area where implementing a blockchain solution is a great use case.

> *“Instead of keeping separate records based on transaction receipts, companies can write their transactions directly into a joint register, creating an interlocking system of enduring accounting records.”*\
> — [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/Innovation/Blockchain_A%20game-changer%20in%20accounting.pdf)

Recording company transactions on a blockchain makes them visible to all parties involved and therefore independently verifiable. Being able to view data like this gives investors and potential clients confidence and complete certainty that the company has a healthy balance sheet and is operating under good business practices.

It’s similar to how a [proof of reserves (PoR) audit](https://milkroad.com/exchanges/proof-of-reserves/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Proof%20Of%20Reserves,on%20behalf%20of%20its%20users.) today helps verify that a crypto exchange actually holds the assets it claims to on behalf of its users, rather than users just having to trust the exchange (we certainly don’t need another example of how this can go wrong!).

The immutability of a blockchain ensures that participants are responsible for their actions, as once a mistake occurs, a participant can only add a new record to correct the error. A record of the error itself can never be erased. This makes a blockchain the ultimate record in proving the reliability of previous transactions — it provides a single source of truth, which is updated and verified by the network in real time.

### Automation

Automation is a must have in any modern accounting process. Unfortunately, even for the well intentioned, traditional accounting can be subject to human error. Despite technological advances, many accounting tasks still rely on manual input. This can lead to discrepancies in reporting and accounting, a major problem for any company caught making such a mistake (as [Lyft found out in February 2024](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lyft-shares-profit-margins-typo-regulatory-filing)).

As we’ll dive into a bit more later, one of the primary ways blockchain can automate accounting is through the use of [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp), self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They help alleviate the need for manual intervention and the potential for human error.

Just one example of a company using blockchain to improve its automation process is VISMA | Yuki, a Swedish software company with 1.7 million customers and revenue over €650 million [in Q4 2023](https://www.visma.com/news/visma-rounds-off-2023-with-strong-growth-and-arr-of-23-billion). VISMA | Yuki [partnered with mintBlue](https://mintblue.com/visma-yuki-blockchain/) in February 2022 to incorporate blockchain into its accounting platform.

The agreement enables automatic verification of the authenticity of receipts and invoices by mintBlue for completely secure automation of invoice processing and payment.

> *“We are taking a big step towards realising our goal; a 100% automated accounting system.”*\
> — Jeroen van Haasteren, Head of Product at VISMA | Yuki

So there are definitely benefits to using blockchain in accounting, but what are some of the issues a company might face when implementing it?

## <div id="challenges">The Challenges To Blockchain In Accounting</div>

### Scalability

Blockchains, particularly public ones, can face scalability issues due to the amount of computational power and time required to process transactions. As the volume of transactions increases, the time to process and validate them on the blockchain often leads to inefficiencies. For accounting purposes, where timely processing of transactions is crucial, scalability issues could pose a major challenge if not fixed.

Thankfully, improving scalability is a big focus for blockchain developers and a lot of resources are going into it. Not to mention, different blockchains naturally have different characteristics. One of the quickest and most cost efficient is the BSV blockchain which can theoretically [handle 1.4 billion transactions in a day](https://www.bsvblockchain.org/news/mintblue-smashes-proof-of-work-record-50-million-transactions).

On 15th March 2023, [mintBlue published 50.53 million transactions](https://mintblue.com/world-record-transactions-push) to this blockchain in 24 hours, 20 times more transactions than iDeal and Adyen do combined on an average day. The cost to record all of these on the BSV blockchain was just $325, far cheaper than most others.

More solutions to the scalability issue are available and being developed. But a bigger problem could come in the form of regulations and a lack of clear guidelines.

### Regulatory & Legal Uncertainties

The regulatory environment surrounding blockchain is still evolving, with many jurisdictions yet to fully establish laws and regulations that govern its use. Unfortunately, blockchain often gets mistakenly equated with cryptocurrency, which does nothing to help its reputation amongst regulators and the broader public. The lack of clear guidelines, which the [US Securities and Exchange Commission seems reluctant to provide](https://www.bsc.news/post/sec-rejects-coinbases-plea-for-clear-crypto-rules-amid-ongoing-legal-battle), make it harder for organisations to implement blockchain within their accounting practices.

Given the relative nascency of the the technology however, perhaps it’s not totally reasonable to expect regulators to have clear guidelines currently laid out about how to work with it. The path towards these guidelines is one that will likely be walked tentatively by governments given blockchain’s growing popularity and its unfortunate conflation with crypto, but progress is being made.

So, both these issues are being worked on and will almost certainly improve over time. But what are companies doing when it comes to improving and building blockchains into accounting today?

## <div id="development">The Development Of Blockchain In Accounting Services</div>

At the moment, the applications of blockchain to accounting (and most other fields) are in the early stages. But companies are already conducting research into how blockchain solutions could disrupt or be applied to their own businesses.

### KPMG

KPMG [offers their clients](https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/services/blockchain-services.html) the ability to “Tap into the transformative power of blockchain.” They offer clients services related to blockchain auditing, taxes, consulting, and blockchain accelerators for younger companies looking to build a product and take it to market.

> *“From financial services to agriculture, these emerging technologies possess the power to discover unforeseen opportunity, while enabling trust, streamlined data reconciliation, immutability and transparency.”*\
> — KPMG

### Quant

[Quant](https://quant.network/), a company that helps banks and other financial institutions embed tokenised assets into their business, branded 2024 as blockchain’s “[year of institutional adoption](https://quant.network/perspectives/blockchain-in-2024-the-year-of-institutional-adoption/).” In 2021 they partnered with cloud database company Oracle to improve blockchain interoperability using their flagship product [Overledger](https://quant.network/overledger-platform/), a solution built for businesses seeking a simple and reliable way to connect to the blockchain world.

### PwC

PwC claim [on their site](https://www.pwc.co.uk/blockchain.html) that “Blockchain is one of the most exciting technologies to emerge in years.” They offer businesses *blockchain specialists* and a four step process to help them determine whether or not using a blockchain could add value or whether their business objectives could be met in a different way. In 2020, [it partnered with](https://www.pwc.ch/de/press-room/press-releases/PwC_MM_ChainSecurity_e.pdf) the one of the leading smart contract auditing services, Swiss firm [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/). It says the agreement will “give large regulated companies the security and trust they need to deploy blockchain technology on a broad basis.”

### AICPA-CIMA

The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants together with The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants developed its [own blockchain course](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/cpe-learning/course/blockchain-fundamentals-for-accounting-and-finance-professionals-certificate). The programme aims to equip CFOs and other finance professionals with the ability to identify opportunities for its use and give them a deeper understanding of blockchain fundamentals.

Overall, the future looks bright for the industry. Despite its issues and sometimes murky reputation (largely thanks to its aforementioned unfortunate association with cryptocurrency), blockchain development tends to move fast. Where might the future of blockchain in accounting take us?

## <div id="future">The Future Of Blockchain In Accounting</div>

There are dozens of areas of research that could be listed when it comes to blockchain development. Here I’ll focus on what I think are a few of the most interesting and important.

### Smart Contracts

As we briefly saw before, these allow terms of an agreement, embedded in code, to be executed upon the fulfilment of a pre-determined condition. They automate a transaction and make it available and publicly verifiable on a blockchain.

These self-executing contracts have the terms of the agreement embedded in code and providing a transparent and efficient system for managing financial operations. Since the terms are directly embedded into the contract, transactions can be publicly verified with greater ease and less reliance on manual checks. They can be used to ensure compliance with financial regulations and help simplify the auditing process.

There is [a lot of research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368500729_Smart_Contracts_in_Blockchain_Technology_A_Critical_Review) going on into their possible applications in a whole host of fields. But if their use in accounting becomes commonplace, they promise to disrupt the industry in a way that few technologies have in our lifetime.

### Asset Tokenisation

Hearing the term *asset tokenisation* might bring back memories of [2021’s NFT boom](https://www.artnews.com/list/art-news/artists/2021-year-of-the-nft-1234614022/). Although the reputation of NFTs might not have done anything to help the reputation of blockchain itself, the process of tokenising assets does actually have practical use cases that don’t involve selling images of [apes for millions of dollars](https://hypebeast.com/2021/10/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-3-4-million-record-sothebys-metaverse).

Asset tokenisation enables assets, whether tangible like real estate and art or intangible like intellectual property, to be divided into shareable, digital tokens that represent ownership or a claim to a portion of the asset's value.

It’s a controversial topic but has the potential to fundamentally change traditional accounting practices and the broader finance industry. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, [has said it will herald](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/12/blackrocks-larry-fink-says-bitcoin-etfs-are-just-the-first-step-in-the-technological-revolution-of-finance.html) “step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets.”

Tokenisation lowers the barriers to entry for investment in high-value assets and makes them more affordable to the average person by subdividing them into digital tokens. This would likely mean a marketplace where asset valuations are more volatile and influenced by a larger investor base.

Traditional accounting practices, which are often relatively slow to report updates in asset valuations, could struggle to keep pace with the real-time data provided by a tokenised asset market. Blockchain however offers a way for anyone with permission to view changes in real time, leading to a more accurate decision-making process when deciding on the valuation of an asset or company.

### Triple-Entry Bookkeeping

The term *triple-entry bookkeeping* was initially coined in 1986 by a Japanese [accounting scholar named Yuji Ijiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Ijiri). He had the idea that a third layer of entries should be added to the debit and credit entries in a company’s accounts to explain changes in income.

The term was later redefined in 2005 by Ian Grigg, a financial cryptographer, in an [article on his own website](https://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html). He proposed a third layer of entries which would be a cryptographically verified and digitally signed receipt to verify transactions between two parties. If a change of ownership of an asset occurs, the third entry is updated and shared in real time.

This solves one of the issues with today’s double entry bookkeeping — there’s not really any connection between the two sets of accounts. Each party holds the records themselves separately which creates a trust problem for third parties who may potentially want to invest in the company. How do they know which set of books to trust if there are discrepancies? They ask auditors to look into the books themselves, often a time consuming and expensive process.

The third entry would allow both parties to view and verify the transaction and cut out the need for an audit trail or reconciliation with an intermediary. When a transaction is recorded in the blockchain, it serves as both a receipt and as evidence of a transaction between the two parties.

## <div id="conclusion">Conclusion</div>

The creation of the first blockchain, centuries after the foundational principles of modern accounting were laid, has opened new doors to improving the security, transparency, and efficiency within the industry. Although not a silver bullet, its use can help address many of the problems accounting has today.

It isn’t just resolving current inefficiencies but offers a clear path towards innovation in the field through things like like triple-entry bookkeeping and smart contracts. The ongoing research and development, spearheaded by leading accounting firms and technology companies, are hopefully guiding us towards a more transparent and efficient accounting future.

Problems, particularly around regulation and scalability remain, but if these can be sufficiently addressed, blockchain could revolutionise and massively improve what we think of as accounting today.
