## <div id="introduction">Introduction</div>

The definition of digital identity seems self-explanatory — it’s an online identity for either a person or organisation.

I remember first hearing about this as a kid when everyone was going wild posting personal information during the beginnings of social media. And then someone held up a teeny red flag to draw attention to the fact that once you post something online, it’s pretty hard to get rid of. That reminds me, my moody Myspace updates might still be out there somewhere...

Anyway, while some of your digital identity is intentional, like social media posts, some of it is unintentional, like the personal data websites collect along a user journey. That’s why it’s important to understand what digital identities are, how to take ownership of them, and how to ensure your information is secure.

As technology becomes more and more integrated in our everyday lives, we increasingly use services that require digital identities. Think online health records, bank statements, and the like. The EU and other governments around the world have worked hard to keep pace and have implemented several policies that promote the use of digital IDs in a consistent and regulated way.

This article will go through these policies while also discussing how blockchain can, and does, enhance these efforts. I’ll also describe what digital IDs currently look like in the EU as well as provide a future outlook.

## <div id="what-why">Digital Identity: What It Is & Why It’s Important</div>

As I mentioned, digital identities (also referred to as electronic identifications or eIDs) have come a long way. It used to be quite easy (maybe too easy) to make accounts, sign in, and just generally access platforms with little protection in place. In hindsight, it felt a little like the wild west of the internet.

Of course some of this still rings true — internet trolls on social media are a great example — but outside of social media, things have become a lot more sophisticated. A good example of this is using two-factor authentication when signing into banking or other apps with sensitive information.

To avoid making this concept feel abstract, a few characteristics of digital identities can be as simple as usernames, passwords, and date of birth. Others can provide a bit more detail like purchase history, medical history, and search history. More recently, things like academic qualifications, employee IDs, and electronic health records have all been made part of our digital identity. I see digital IDs succeeding physical IDs, like driver’s licenses and passports, in the same way contactless payment is slowly replacing debit cards.

There are of course pros and cons to housing more personal information online. Pros being that you can prove your identity without having to carry around different forms of IDs, or you can access your qualifications and medical information online rather than digging them out of an old filing cabinet. And, it’s harder to lose or forget them — which is a real win for people like me.

The downfall of digital IDs is that they will take some getting used to, much like other forms of technology. This will be especially true for the older generation. Furthermore, they come with a list of risks such as new identity fraud methods, system breakdowns, and more. I’ll get into that a little later on.

Governments have jumped on the bandwagon to use digital identities, mainly because they’ve had to in order to keep pace with innovations. The EU has presented its future outlook on using [digital IDs for all EU citizens](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en), with the goal being to ensure that every EU citizen who is eligible for a national ID card will also have a digital ID as well.

Well-known international law firm Bird & Bird paraphrases the EU’s most [updated text](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/one-step-closer-to-the-final-approval-of-the-eidas-regulation-reform#:~:text=On%2029%20February%202024%2C%20the,expected%20to%20be%20in%20March) as:

> *“\[A]n electronic identification \[that] enables users to securely store, manage and validate a person’s identification data and electronic attestations of attributes, facilitating their provision to relying parties and other \[European Digital Identity] Wallet users. Additionally, it allows for signing with qualified electronic signatures and sealing through qualified electronic seals.”*

These will be available on the [Wallet app](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/What+is+the+wallet) for citizens to prove their identity both online and offline, along with things like right to live, work, and study. I talk about this in more detail in a [previous article about identity authentication](https://policyblocks.co/identity-authentication/).  

eIDs are part of the [regulation on electronic identification and trust services](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) (eIDAS), which, at the time of writing, the EU is in the midst of approving. This allows citizens to use their eIDs to access services across the EU. The hope here is that it creates an EU-internal market with citizens able to prove their legal status digitally in the same way they would do using paper equivalents. The regulation is now going through formal adoption procedures in the EU Council and it should be finalised in the next few months.

## <div id="blockchain">EU Digital Identity Solutions & Blockchain</div>

You’re probably thinking: *Cool, but what does blockchain have to do with this?* And the answer is: everything.

I’ll first go through some of the pros of relying on blockchain and then move to provide examples of how it is used.

Let’s start by revisiting the secure and decentralised nature of blockchain. Because the technology is inherently decentralised, it means that users’ personal information isn’t reliant on one entity. This is avoids worries of data breeches, corruption, and puts users more in control of their information. Not only that, but it also gives users the ability to track and trace documents through their entire life cycle.

It’s also cost-effective and scalable since it isn’t reliant on a middle man to help facilitate transactions. In turn, it also reduces paperwork and bottlenecks within the system, which again saves time and therefore money.

Blockchain-as-a-Service provider [mintBlue](https://mintblue.com/visma-yuki-blockchain/) demonstrated the technology’s scalability by reaching a [record-breaking 50 million transactions in 24 hours](https://mintblue.com/world-record-transactions-push/) through using their approach on the BSV protocol, which highlights the need to choose the right blockchain. mintBlue describes using BSV as simply: “infinitely scalable with low cost transactions and no ongoing storage costs.”

All of these attributes position blockchain to effectively enhance digital identity solutions. And governments are very aware of the benefits.

This is exactly why the EU is in the midst of developing a [European Blockchain Services Infrastructure](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-blockchain-services-infrastructure) (EBSI) in conjunction with the [European Blockchain Partnership (EBP)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/blockchain-partnership). The EBP is made up of the 27 EU countries, plus Norway, Liechtenstein, and the European Commission. The idea is that each member in the EBP will run at least one node (effectively a device that runs the software) in a network of interconnected, peer-to-peer nodes.

At the moment, it allows public organisations access to the infrastructure, and there is a tender running until the end of March 2024 for private companies to participate through what the EU calls the [European Blockchain Sandbox](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/applications-are-now-open-second-cohort-european-blockchain-sandbox).

While it’s too soon to tell what this is going to look like, I am patiently (impatiently!) waiting to see it all roll out, as it will allow things like notarisation, verification, and eIDs all to take place on the network. A good example of this is allowing citizens control over their educational credentials. By making them available on the network, it will eliminate verification costs, provide proof of authenticity, and put citizens in control of their personal data and credentials.

In line with this, the EBSI showcases a [success story](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Licence+to+practice) of EU citizens applying for jobs in one country, with a degree from another. It highlights that professionals in many countries around Europe need to legally have a license or certificate to practice. In addition to administration costs and human error, it takes a minimum of three months to have a license-to-practice issued. Through verifying educational credentials and issuing license-to-practice credentials through using EBSI, citizens can easily access and provide information across borders digitally.

![The EU's Blockchain-Based Digital Identity Solutions](/assets/pb6-digital-identity-solutions-article-image-1.jpg "The EU's Blockchain-Based Digital Identity Solutions")

Another example is through using the EBSI for [European Qualification Passports for Refugees](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/x/sQHaIg). In Italy, there is an initiative to support higher education institutions to recognise foreign qualifications and they adopted blockchain in 2019 to help do so. The Italian Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA) has also been involved in the European Qualification Passport for Refugees project, which helps assess refugees’ qualifications when there is insufficient or missing documents. By using blockchain, EQPR holders can digitally share their qualifications all across the EU.

As EBSI initiatives continue to grow, they will inevitably revolutionise much of the way everyday administration tasks take place.

And there are plenty of future initiatives in the pipeline too, including financing SMEs, using EU social security numbers to allow access to welfare services across borders, and facilitating asylum processes. This is truly ground breaking and a huge step forward in the way the EU will interact with blockchain.

The EBP aims to further develop the EU strategy on blockchain and work to support the broad deployment of blockchain services in the EU.

> *“In the future, all public services will use blockchain technology. Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies.”*\
> — [Mariya Gabriel, the then Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/blockchain-partnership)

As a final note here, it’s worth mentioning that some of this is already in the making in some Member States. For example, Germany has an eID function within the [German National Identity Card](https://www.personalausweisportal.de/Webs/PA/EN/citizens/electronic-identification/electronic-identification-node.html). But it’s currently quite limited in its offering and is really just a stepping stone to the offerings I listed above. Denmark also has their [Danish National eID (MitID)](https://en.digst.dk/systems/mitid/eid-in-denmark/) and describes it as “enhancing the scope for communications between residents and the public sector.” It offers access to a healthcare app to prove eligibility for healthcare in Denmark, as well as a driving license app to prove identities. These features will be further enhanced by the EU’s vision for eIDs and are set to become interconnected with the rest of the region.

## <div id="future-outlook">Future Outlook for Digital Identity Solutions</div>

As I mentioned, all of this comes with risks. The first being that the EU will have to ensure it is consistent across the board, particularly with its eID scheme. That not only means ensuring all Member States have the capacity to make this available, but also increasing citizen acceptance, and understanding of how it all works. Which leads me to my next point.

There’s a level of digital education that needs to take place when implementing the EBSI, eIDs, and the like. According to the EU, [32% of all Europeans](https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/datastories/digital-literacy-eu-overview#:~:text=Currently%2C%20more%20than%2090%20%25%20of,still%20lack%20basic%20digital%20skills.) still lack basic digital skills, which complicates implementing more complex technologies, such as blockchain.

While the digital wallet and eID is optional and offline measures can still be used, it will no doubt complicate the current system through introducing an additional variable. Citizens will need easy access, assurance that it is safe and secure, and training to ensure they can get the most out of the technology.

This transition may be easy for those of us who have grown up online, but what about our parents? More than [one-fifth of the population](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Population_structure_and_ageing#:~:text=On%201%20January%202023%2C%20the,aged%2065%20years%20and%20over.&text=On%201%20January%202023%2C%20the%20median%20age%20of,EU's%20population%20reached%2044.5%20years.) is aged 65 years and over. I have a hard time explaining to my mom what wifi even is, let alone trying to explain to her not to enter personal information using a public network.

All of this leads me to my last point, that moving everything online will no doubt open up a window of opportunity for new online scams. I believe the digital education and literacy piece is absolutely crucial to protect the older generation who are still getting to grips with online protocols.

## <div id="conclusion">Concluding Thoughts</div>

Aside from my caution pertaining to the digital literacy side of things, I think the policies I covered in this article launch the EU into the future of both digital identity and blockchain. They are forward-thinking and allow citizens to complete everyday tasks through simply using their smartphones.

By integrating blockchain in more aspects of everyday life, citizens will come to learn more about the technology and see the benefits first hand. I find the prospect of being able to do so much of my general life admin, like taxes, banking, and health services all in one place exciting. While it will take some getting used to, I can see it becoming a simplified, mainstream port of call for many of our everyday tasks.

Digital identities have progressed significantly and we find ourselves in an exciting time full of innovation and new regulations. The EU is actively embracing digital identities to keep pace with these innovations. Its focus on implementing policies like eIDAS showcase a commitment to providing citizens with a plan for how it will move forward. The EBSI demonstrates the EU’s forward-thinking approach to adopting blockchain to enhance digital identify solutions, and I think that’s the right move.
