## <div id="what">What Are Micropayments?</div>

Although there’s no exact definition, micropayments (also known as microtransactions) are generally accepted as being small payments made online. Their popularity grew significantly throughout the 2010s, but since the pandemic and our world’s general digitalisation boom, their use has skyrocketed. From video games to [heated seats](https://www.bmwblog.com/2022/07/29/bmw-micro-transactions-what-it-means), whether you like them or not, micropayments are becoming an ever-larger part of modern life.

But despite their growing popularity, it’s still sometimes difficult to use traditional payment systems to make them.

How might blockchain applications be able to help with this issue that the microtransactions industry is facing? Here, we’ll take a look at how they can be used together and some of the issues that might hinder the progress of these two growing industries.

## <div id="understanding">Understanding Micropayments</div>

The term micropayments was originally coined by futurist [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) in the 1960s. He believed they would one day be a way for people to purchase content on a network and create a low-cost but high-volume business model for the companies that employed them. They would have been, and might still become, an alternative to the online advertising model most businesses rely on today.

US computer scientist [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier) has [written extensively](https://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html) about the problems that the ad model is causing for society as a whole. The social media companies that sell the ads are incentivised to show content that keeps people on the platform, and unfortunately, this content is often the same type that divides and angers people. He came up with the acronym [BUMMER (Behavior of Users Modified and Made into an Empire for Rent)](https://lawliberty.org/social-media-what-a-bummer/) to describe this new business model.

Micropayments however offer the chance for payments to flow the other way. Some companies are now offering to pay users for their data. [Tapestri](https://tapestri.io/), for example, offers users money in exchange for almost constant access to their location. [Caden](https://www.caden.io) gives users cash if they pair their other accounts to it, such as Netflix or Amazon. It then anonymises their data and then sells it to other services. User data might still be getting sold, but at least the users themselves are getting compensated for providing it. So, as ever, there are two sides to the proliferation of the technology.

Although first conceived of decades ago, microtransactions didn’t really take off until online games like World of Warcraft and Runescape became popular and players could buy in-game items using real world currency. Nowadays, microtransactions are fairly common, and their use, much to the annoyance of some consumers, is growing fast.

### Types of Micropayments

There are several popular forms of micropayment, including:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: You pay for each piece of content you consume or a service as you use it. This model is popular with some online media platforms which allow you to pay a small amount to read a single article rather than paying a monthly subscription.
* **Prepay**: You load a certain amount of money into the account you’ll make your microtransactions from and the funds are deducted as you use the services. This is common in gaming where users often have to buy a set amount of “gems” or “coins” with fiat currency and can then spend them in-game. Once they run out, they have to pay again to buy more. However, this system can come with it’s own set of problems for the player, which we’ll explore in more detail later.
* **Postpay**: You get access to the content first and pay later. This system is common in streaming services where a user may pay for what they’ve watched/listened to over the past month. The obvious issue here is that it’s easy to lose track of how much content you’ve consumed and then overspend.
* **Collaborative**: Multiple users pay into a pool of funds which is then sent to creators/publishers based on the preferences of the users. It can allow smaller creators to benefit from the existence of larger creators on the same platform, rather than being pushed out by them. It’s not a perfect example, but it’s similar to how Spotify works: your monthly subscription fee is allocated to artists according to your listening habits.
* **Donation-based**: You donate to content creators if you like their content. One example in the Web3 world is [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/page/how-it-works), where users can tip a creator of an article from a pool of funds whilst also receiving a small portion of the tip themselves.

![Publish0x tipping system](/assets/bf3-micropayments-2.png "Publish0x tipping system")

*Being able to tip authors and receive money for reading an article is certainly a novel concept and offers benefits to the reader and the consumer, but it's unclear how viable it is as a large-scale and long-term business model.*

### Micropayments vs. Subscriptions

Micropayments are generally made as a one off payment whereas subscriptions are ongoing. Perhaps the main problem that micropayments solve is that you avoid having to pay subscriptions to platforms where you might only want to use their services once a month, for example. With micropayments, you can pay small, manageable, one-off payments for specific content or services — a flexible alternative to full subscription models or ad-supported access.

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to make a one off payment of $0.05 to read a single article, rather than $20/month subscription to only read 2-3 articles a month from the publication?

So now that we’ve learned a bit about the development of micropayments and how they work, let’s have a look at some of the issues with them and see how blockchain could improve the micropayment process.

## <div id="blockchain">How Can Blockchain Improve Micropayments?</div>

In 2014, famous venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote an essay in The New York Times titled “[Why Bitcoin Matters](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/)”. The essay outlines a vision for the future of the cryptocurrency and why he believed it would herald a new era of micropayments.

> *“A third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments. Micropayments have never been feasible, despite 20 years of attempts, because it is not cost effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable.”*\
> — Marc Andreessen, [Why Bitcoin Matters](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters)

A full implementation obviously hasn’t come to pass and, in the case of Bitcoin, is unlikely to ever do so on a large scale due to the [technical and legal challenges](https://www.abacademies.org/articles/an-overview-of-bitcoins-legal-and-technical-challenges-7863.html) associated with it. Other blockchains don’t have these problems, however.

Combining faster and more cost efficient blockchain platforms with micropayment infrastructure offers many advantages over traditional micropayments systems. We’ll first take a look at two of these advantages in this section and then cover some of the issues associated.

### Lowering Transaction Fees & Times

Micropayments today remain difficult to implement in many traditional payment systems due to high transaction fees and slow processing times. Although some blockchain protocols are still plagued by the same issues (and sometimes to an even greater degree), others can offer a solution to both of these problems.

With traditional payment processing, below a certain threshold, the transaction fee for making a payment can become a large portion of its total value. This makes the payment itself difficult to justify for the consumer. Credit card companies generally charge merchants a lump sum and a percentage of the transaction and this can often add up to [1.5-3.5% of its total value](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/credit-card-processing-fees).

Let’s take a look at how much this might add up to for a micropayment. Since the smallest building block of a fiat currency is generally 1% of the whole, the minimum fee a credit card company would charge would be $0.01, £0.01, etc.

If your whole micropayment is for just $0.02, it’s easy to see how the processing fee of $0.01 on top of that can become an issue — 33% of the total cost of the transaction is from fees alone!

![Average credit card processing fees](/assets/bf3-micropayments-3.png "Average credit card processing fees")

*Image source: [EBizCharge](https://ebizcharge.com/blog/what-are-the-average-credit-card-processing-fees-that-merchants-pay/)*

In 2022, [US merchants paid $126.4 billion](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/) to credit card processing companies in total. At the moment, there’s also an extraordinary lack of competition in the space: Visa and Mastercard have a virtual duopoly on the industry and, as [this great article from Quartr shows](https://quartr.com/insights/company-research/visa-and-mastercard-the-global-payment-duopoly), excluding China, they make up 90% of global payments processing.

But thankfully, we’re starting to see the emergence of a new form of payment processing, an alternative to the current Visa/Mastercard duopoly — blockchain payments. They might have their own issues, which can vary depending on the blockchain in question, but they’re improving quick and their reputation of having high transaction fees and slow processing times is now undeserved in many cases.

On the [BSV blockchain](https://www.bsvblockchain.org/) for example, transactions normally take just two seconds regardless of where in the world they are being sent. The recent Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain has also pushed the [transaction cost and time down](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/14/layer-2-blockchains-become-cheaper-after-ethereums-dencun-upgrade/) for applications built upon it.

> *“Sending £100 securely to the other side of the world in seconds isn’t remarkable, sending £0.0001p is“.*\
> — [Daniel Connolly](https://www.bsvblockchain.org/technology/instant-transaction), BSV Lead Developer

Of course, not all blockchains are suitable for micropayments. Transaction time on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain varies, but can often be over an hour, and in extreme cases, [upwards of 100 hours](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/avg-confirmation-time?timespan=180days)! Transaction fees can also be [higher than $10](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/fees-usd-per-transaction).

But clearly a third alternative is needed to the current Visa/Mastercard duopoly. Blockchain micropayments can act as this alternative and offer a new option for sending very small amounts of money online at very little cost.

### Improving Accessibility

The gig economy is one the rise and using blockchain for micropayments can also help here. Gig economy workers, largely independent contractors and freelancers, are often hampered by the issue of slow payments. The traditional financial system, with its high transaction fees and slow processing times, has been less than ideal for handling these sometimes small payments efficiently.

This inefficiency not only makes it difficult for gig workers to manage their money, but also limits the scope of projects employers are willing to offer. In a manner similar to the payment processing we saw above, the cost of processing payments for the employer can sometimes outweigh the value of the work itself if it was only a very small project.

Projects like [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) (a “microtask” outsourcing platform) are great for opening up access to jobs for everyone. But [Amazon still takes a 20% fee](https://www.mturk.com/pricing#:~:text=MTurk%20Fee,per%20assignment%20or%20bonus%20payment.) of the payment. [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), a popular freelancing platform, charges freelancers 10% of their payment for jobs completed on the platform. Taking 10% or more of a worker’s wage (before taxes) is no small amount. Wouldn’t it be better to cut out the intermediary and go direct to the company/employee?

Blockchain can also makes micropayments available to those in the developing world where banks might be reluctant to offer financial services due to a lack of trust or reliable financial infrastructure. Blockchain allows for a decentralised platform where transactions can occur directly between parties without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or payment processors, to verify the transaction.

In some ways, this might not be a good thing. Removing the need for verification of the seller/buyer might make the transaction more open to fraud, but at least it makes them viable to those who can’t even get access to bank accounts or financial institutions at the moment. Not to mention, there are identity management and verification systems that can be looped into the process as well.

For many, this peer-to-peer approach drastically reduces transaction costs and makes it economically feasible to send and receive small amounts of money across borders and back home to their families.

## <div id="challenges-issues">Micropayments Challenges & Issues</div>

Although blockchain applications hold promise for micropayment services, they’re certainly not without their own problems. Two of the main ones being the current perception of both micropayments and blockchain, and the opaque and developing regulatory issues that plague the broader Web3 ecosystem.

### Perception

Unfortunately, the reputation of micropayments has done little to help their growth. Even back in [2010, fraudsters were using micropayments](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/21544/fraudsters-pocket-10-million-in-four-year-micro-payment-scam) to scam people. The amounts taken are sometimes so small that people don’t even bother reporting the crime, but over time, they can really add up.

The reputation of micropayments has also suffered with their introduction into video games. It’s estimated that about [5-20% of video game players](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022216/how-microtransactions-are-evolving-economics-gaming.asp) make microtransactions and that the market will be worth about [$74 billion by 2025](https://www.statista.com/statistics/558952/in-game-consumer-spending-worldwide/), but a lot of gamers hate the fact that they’ve become so widespread in the industry.

Many believe that they’ve simply made many online games “pay to win”, where the people who are willing to spend the most are the ones who ultimately become the best players. This creates a massive incentive for people to spend more money on the game over time, but also generates more revenue for the company that created the game.

Perhaps the most famous example of this are “loot boxes”. Once the player buys a loot box, they receive a collection of random items, some of which can be good, but loot boxes also encourage them to continue paying for them until they get the item they want. [Some research](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/staff-perspective-paper-loot-box-workshop/loot_box_workshop_staff_perspective.pdf) even suggests that this can contribute to  the development of gambling addictions later in life.

Many are now also fed up of companies charging for things that used to be free, even if the prices might be relatively low. Things like paying for [emojis and skins](https://www.vg247.com/for-a-game-that-promised-no-microtransactions-the-division-sure-does-have-a-lot-of-expensive-microtransactions) have made people reluctant to pay extra for things that aren’t really that important.

Combine this with the reputation of blockchain (and the fact that it’s seen as synonymous with crypto by many) and it means that, unfortunately, much of the general public are turned off when they hear the terms “micropayment” or “blockchain”. It might not exactly be a rosy outlook for any project associated with the combination of the two or for those trying to build a micropayment infrastructure on top of a blockchain.

### Regulatory Issues

Much like the general public, regulators also seem suspect of both micropayments and blockchain applications, so combining them and then getting regulators to view them in a different light will likely pose a challenge.

The EU already has a regulation which [places a lower limit](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.micropaymentsimpactonnpaymentsecosystem202308~bb92cda8ce.en.pdf#page=12) on the value of payments in Europe to €0.01. It’s regulations like these which could pose a problem for those wanting to make a transaction of just a few cents. That €0.01 can end up becoming a large portion of the transaction itself.

The lack of regulations in the blockchain space also creates ambiguity for developers building applications that use them. Without clear regulatory frameworks, businesses face uncertainly about the legality and reliability of blockchain-based transactions. This also serves to stifle consumer and investor confidence in the industry.

Clear regulations that lay out exactly what can and can’t be done with blockchain, as well as making micropayments viable with the technology, are still needed for it to gain wider acceptance and for its full potential to be realised. Whether this will happen is still unclear. Up until now however, officials have seemed [reluctant to create clear guidelines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/06/26/web3-is-becoming-more-popular-wheres-the-regulation/?sh=5c6f21aac358) for regulating Web3 technology.

## <div id="future">The Future of Micropayments & Blockchain</div>

The micropayments industry is growing fast and whether you like it or not, its use is only likely to grow.

Startups like [Centi are developing blockchain applications](https://www.eu-startups.com/2023/12/zurich-based-centi-closes-e1-8-to-advance-blockchain-based-micropayments-and-financial-inclusion) for micropayments. They aim to address their current inefficiencies and make microtransactions accessible to all.

> *“We founded Centi driven by the potential of blockchain for micropayments and financial inclusion.”*\
> — Bernhard Müller, Co-Founder of [Centi](https://centi.ch/)

X (Twitter) will reportedly launch a [peer-to-peer payments service](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/transforming-the-global-town-square) sometime this year. Elon Musk is on record saying he wants to allow publishers on the platform to “charge on a per article basis with one click.” He said this would [launch in May 2023](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652349875017879552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1652349875017879552%7Ctwgr%5E067b7390df8bad6bdf0747c4f2df338aff7f1952%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalism.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmicropayments-on-twitter-good-or-bad-for-publisher-s-business-models-%2Fs2%2Fa1033978%2F). As ever, his prediction wasn’t quite on time, but it’s clearly something that’s on his mind.

Given Musk’s [affinity for blockchain applications](https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-wants-twitter-payments-system-built-with-crypto-in-mind), might we one day see X running its payments business on some sort of blockchain and Marc Andreessen’s prediction of micropayments running on the same technology finally coming true?

It might not be too long until both of these become a tangible reality.

## <div id="conclusion">Conclusion</div>

Up until now, the growth of micropayments, although impressive, has been hampered by the high processing fees and slow transaction times associated with the legacy financial systems we’re still stuck with today.

These issues highlight the need for a more efficient solution and this is where blockchain could help. Leveraging the advantages of blockchain, such as lower transaction costs and faster processing times, would help the micropayments industry overcome its current constraints, making small-value transactions more viable and appealing to both consumers and merchants.

Despite its promise however, the integration of blockchain into the microtransaction ecosystem is not without its challenges. Issues such as regulatory hurdles and overcoming the scepticism surrounding both micropayments and blockchain must be addressed for blockchain applications to reach their full potential.

It’s crucial that developers and people involved in the space navigate these challenges thoughtfully and ensure that the benefits of blockchain-enhanced micropayments can be fully realised, thereby breaking the existing payment processing duopoly and opening new avenues for financial inclusion and digital commerce.
