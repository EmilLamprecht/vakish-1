## About me: Sam Liddell

Hey, I’m Sam, an explorer, tinkerer, and occasional writer. As a techno-optimist and part-time degenerate, I’ve been watching the blockchain space for quite some time!

I’m especially interested in how the technology can be used for social good by impact organisations. Blockchain has faced a lot of criticism, some definitely warranted of course, but there are all sorts of organisations using the technology to help make the world a better place.

I hope that anyone interested in these topics will find something in my articles that grabs them!

*If you like what I’m writing or have any questions, drop a comment. I’d be happy to read from you!*

## Who funds this blog?

Full disclosure: This blog is funded through partnerships with entities like mintBlue, which are deeply invested in blockchain and related technologies.

Despite this sponsorship, I only publish content that I believe provides a truthful and clear view of the topics at hand. My sole financial interest is the upfront sponsorship for writing these articles.

If you have any questions or feel that there is a bias in my work, please leave a comment on the respective articles or contact me at (disguised to avoid bots!): {hi} \[at] {hashspark} \[dot] {com}
