## About me: Rachel Byfleet

Hey, I’m Rachel, a London-based communications and policy professional that works with global technology brands.

I hold a MSc in International Public Policy and am well-versed in EU policy and data regulation. I’m passionate about how technology can drive transformation and positively impact society.

With a diverse background and skillset, I strive to craft compelling narratives and policy perspectives about emerging technologies across a wide variety of industries.

## Who funds this blog?

To be transparent, this blog is supported through a collaborative effort with organizations like mintBlue, which have a vested interest in the technologies discussed here and their broader implications.

Despite this financial backing, I am committed to providing content that is truthful and accurately represents the complex world of tech policy. My primary focus is to share insights that are beneficial to our understanding, without any hidden financial agendas beyond the sponsorship for my writing.
