## About me: Harry Harrison

Hey, I’m Harry, a writer and investment manager with a passion for technology and finance. I especially enjoy creating educational and informative content related to these two areas.

I came to blockchain via crypto but have since been quite interested in exploring other uses for the technology and sharing my findings.

I hope professionals across the broader field of finance will gain some new, practical knowledge from my articles!

*If you like what I’m writing or have questions, leave a comment! I’d love to answer your questions!*

## Who funds this blog?

In the spirit of transparency, this blog is financed through collaborations with companies such as mintBlue, which are of course interested in the technologies and innovations we discuss. 

However, rest assured that I only produce and share content that I believe truthfully and accurately reflects the reality of these subjects. My financial interest is limited to the upfront sponsorship for writing these pieces.

If you have any questions or perceive any biases in my articles, please comment on the posts or reach out to me at (disguised to avoid bots!): {hi} \[at] {hashspark} \[dot] {com}
