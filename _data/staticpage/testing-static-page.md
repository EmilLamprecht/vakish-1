## About me: Sam Liddell

Hey, I’m Sam, an avid explorer, startup tinkerer, investor, and occasional writer. As a techno-optimist and part-time degenerate, I’ve been quietly dabbling in the blockchain space for some time now!

Aside from my on-chain explorations, I’m curious about blockchain’s potential for social good. While blockchain has faced a lot of criticism (much of it warranted), there are all sorts of organisations using the technology to help make the world a better place.

It’s these use cases and organisations that I wanted to explore, and I hope that anyone interested in these topics will find something in my articles that inspires them.

*If you like what I’m writing or have any questions, drop a comment. I’d be happy to read from you!*

## Who funds this blog?

Full disclosure: This blog is funded through partnerships with entities like mintBlue, which are deeply invested in blockchain and related technologies.

Despite this sponsorship, I only publish content that I believe provides a truthful and clear view of the topics at hand. My sole financial interest is the upfront sponsorship for writing these articles.
