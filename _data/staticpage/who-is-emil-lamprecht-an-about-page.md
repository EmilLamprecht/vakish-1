  This is a page about Emil Lamprecht. Who is this person anyway? Why bother

# Who Is Emil Lamprecht | An About Page

Firstly, you don't have to read this. I'm just another random person with a bunch of opinions trying to write content that is somehow objectively helpful or interesting but really just boils down to what I happen to have learned through the ups and downs of my weird life, and whether or not that means I know more about any particular thing than you.

Good intro, right?

Don't sweat it, you can think I'm a nobody, I would appreciate that actually, but if you'd like to think I'm somebody, here is some stuff about me you likely wont have found anywhere else on the internet:

## What I Do

I build businesses from the ground up. I designed and implemented new education models for vocational training and entrepreneurship; including over 50 startup accelerators in 34 countries.\
\
I am not a consultant, but I do opt to help 2-3 orgs a year as pro-bono for social impact causes or for hire if I believe the problem really needs solving. Please don't solicit me with agency services; I only respond to help and research inquiries.\
\
Most of my work now revolves around building the companies in our bootstrapped portfolio, supporting research in women's health and insights into complex social behaviors.\
\
I have a mixed marketer and product designer history, but am a prolific user researcher and impact advocate. All about solving real human problems through business.
